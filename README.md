# Predictive-model-for-house-prices.
This project focuses on building a predictive model for house prices using a real-world dataset. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors. 
This project involves multiple stages including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Project Workflow
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing or imputing outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and relationships between features to uncover valuable insights.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and selecting the most relevant features for the predictive model.
Model Training: Using various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to build predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ². Fine-tuning the model to achieve the best accuracy.
